# odin-recipes
A simple boring looking website containing recipes for 3 widely popular beverages.

While building this website I realized that I wrote the same html code for 3 recipe pages. Would've saved me some time if I knew how to build similar  webpages(in my case the recipes pages) without having to write the same code again and again. There's a way but I don't know that yet.
